# research project

## title:

*Disrupting technology - can the planetary technosphere be politically steered toward a post-capitalist social metabolism?*

!---!

# research project

## summary:

> ... structure: mechanisms that drive the development of technologies and accelerate the impact of technosocial processes on Earth's biophysical systems

> ...and agency: how disruption of technological systems can be an enabling factor for climate action, how various social actors can impact the direction of technological change and how technologies, particularly computers and digital networks, help produce climate science and disseminate science data, research and scholarly writing to the actors working in climate action

Note: In my PhD project I intend to theorize what are the **socially structured mechanisms** that drive the development of technologies and accelerate the **impact of technosocial processes on Earth's biophysical systems**. I'll look at how disruption of technological systems, particularly energy systems, **can be an enabling factor for climate action**, how various social actors can **impact the direction of technological change** toward a low-carbon, post-growth and post-capitalist economy, and finally **how technologies, particularly computers and digital networks, help produce climate science and disseminate science data, research and scholarly writing** to the actors working in climate action arena and to the public in general. I'm thus interested in the ambivalence: **how social agents can diminish technology's negative impact by benefiting from the access to data and publishing that the technology enables**.

# research project

## summary:

> ...three case studies:
> first, at the Institute for Political Ecology, an environmentalist group in Croatia;
> second, at a the Unite trade union in the UK;
> third, of academic community devising practices of no-barriers access to scientific publishing, data and information

> ...finally: seeking to contribute and strengthen the work of those communities.

Note: To expand my research empirically, I will conduct three case studies: first, at the Institute for Political Ecology, an environmentalist group in Croatia; second, at a the Unite trade union in the UK; third, of academic community devising practices of no-barriers access to scientific publishing, data and information. The aim is to undestand how environmental activism and union advocacy benefit from access to knowledge, and how access activists can provide vital information of public interest in cases of urgency. As I’m involved in both environmental and access to knowledge communities, and have worked with some of the groups I’ll be observing, my methodology will be community-based, seeking to contribute and strengthen the work of those communities.

## context: environmental humanities

<img src="./hothouse.jpg" height="350" />

<font size="4"> Steffen et al.: "Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene", 2018 </font>

Note: My research falls into the emerging field of **environmental humanities**, a field that has largely sprung up in response to the anthropogenic disruption of Earth's biophysical system and consequences this will have on human societies. They are a critical revision of the **strict separation of human and natural sciences** that has been the hallmark of knowledge production since the 19th century. The defining characteristic of that separation is that it viewed **the natural history and the social history as external to each other**. Given that the nature and the society were assumed to be operating at very different temporal and spatial scales, they could be meaningfully analyzed by unrelated methods of inquiry. Yet with the acceleration of climate change, it has become alarmingly clear that human activities over centuries and millenia have been transforming Earth’s systems at an ever greater scale and that humanity has been increasingly dependent on ever greater adaptation of Earth’s systems to accommodate its growing hunger for energy and resources. My research draws from a variety of fields: environmental science, science and technology studies, political economy, critical theory and Earth science. In my approach I combine both the theories that look at the social structures as forms of causation and theories that look at the situated agency of various social actors at various scales.

# PhD objectives

Phase 1: develop an integrated analytical framework to understand technological development from the perspective of social structure and from the perspective of social agency <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Phase 2: conduct case studies of environmentalists, labour unions and scholarly communities <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Phase 3: write up my research, present back to these communities, and publish journal articles <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Beyond: inspite of a sense of despair surrounding climate change, provide a comprehensive, analytically grounded and political realistic assemsent for an urgent, transnational and transformative action  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note: **1. For the phase 1**, my objective is to conduct a literature review in sociology of technology and science, environmental science, political economy and political theory in order to develop an integrated analytical framework – one that understands technological development and its impact on evinromental systems both from the perspective of capitalist social structure and from the perspective of plural field of social agency. A particular focus of my analysis will be on energy systems and cybernetic systems. **2. In the phase 2**, deploying this analytical framework, I will conduct case studies that will empirically examine - through field work postings and interviews - the forms of agency that environmentalists, labour organisations and scholars are envisioning in regulating and using technological systems in order to make the transition into a post-growth, low-carbon, post-capitalist economy. Of particular interest are visions these actors have of how digital technologies can re-orient the technological change to make that systemic change feasible. **3. In the phase 3**, during my research work and after its completion, through initial presentations to these collective actors, journal articles and presentations at international events, I will ensure that my findings contribute critically and affirmatively to the efforts of these collective actors. **4. Beyond: The ultimate objective of my research is, in a situation of likely runaway climate change, marked by an growing sense of disorientation and despair, to provide a comprehensive, analytically grounded and political realistic assessment if and how can an urgent, transnational and transformative action be organised to avert worse consequences.

# PhD outline & target dates
Phase 1 (by the latter part of January 2019):

> II. Literature review: Technologies and environmental crisis (chapters 2 & 3)
>  1. Technological development and the rise of fossil capital (*done as PHD1.1 submission*)
>  2. Technosphere and agency (*done as PHD1.2 and PHD1.3 submissions*)

Note: My PhD research so far following the targets set in the initial phase of my research. Also, writing of my PhD follows stages of my work: literature review (phase 1), fieldwork and analysis (phase 2), participant’s feedback, write-up and publication (phase 3). As part of phase 1, I have already completed first drafts of my literature review chapters on fossil capitalism (PHD1.1) and technosphere and agency (PHD1.2 and PHD1.3).

# PhD outline
Phase 1 (currently working on):

>III. Methodology of research (chapter 4)
>  1. Community-based participatory action research: researching and working with the actors
>  2. Interdisciplinarity and 'post-normal' science
>  3. Expertise and collective agency

!--!

# PhD outline
Phase 2 (by the latter part of January 2020):

# objectives & plans

| period | activity |
|--|--|
| July-December | fieldwork at the Unite trade union, participant observation at the Coventry University’s open access community |
| November-December  | PHD2.2 submission, drafting of the second and third case study chapters  |
| December | PRP Phase 2 |

Note: In 2019 I plan to complete the Phase 1 work on the chapter on methodology. With the initial draft of the analytical framework thus done, from February on I intend to conduct three case studies that will empirically examine - through fieldwork, open-ended interviews and participant observation - the forms of agency that environmentalists, labour organisations and scholars are pursuing. I hope to be done with empirical work by the end of phase 2, as well as the initial write-up of the case study chapters.
